# Mini-Project-In-PowerBi
This project analyzes crime data from 2022 to the present using Excel and Power BI to identify patterns, trends, and hotspots. The primary goal is to understand crime distribution over time, age group, victim gender, and locations, enabling data-driven decisions and improved resource allocation for law enforcement.
